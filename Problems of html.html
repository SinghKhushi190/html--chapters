    <h1>Akshay Kumar</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Akshay Hari Om Bhatia[1]</b> (born<b> Rajiv Hari Om Bhatia; 9 September 1967[2]),</b> known professionally as
        <b>Akshay Kumar</b> (pronounced [əkˈʂəj kʊˈmaːɾ]), is an Indian actor and film producer working in Hindi cinema.
        Referred to in the media as "Khiladi Kumar",[3][4] through his career spanning over 30 years, Kumar has appeared
        in over 150 films and has won several awards, including two<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Awards">National Film Awards</a> and two Filmfare Awards.
        He received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian honour, from the Government of India in 2009. Kumar
        is one of the most prolific actors in Indian cinema
        Forbes included Kumar in their lists of both highest-paid celebrities and highest-paid actors in the world from
        2015 to 2020.[7][8] Between 2019 and 2020, he was the only Indian on both lists

        Kumar began his career in 1991 with Saugandh and had his first commercial success a year later with the action
        thriller Khiladi. The film established him as an action star in the 1990s and led to several films in the
        Khiladi film series, in addition to other action films such as Mohra (1994) and Jaanwar (1999). Although his
        early tryst with romance in Yeh Dillagi (1994) was positively received, it was in the next decade that Kumar
        expanded his range of roles. He gained recognition for the romantic films Dhadkan (2000), Andaaz (2003),
        Namastey London (2007), and for his slapstick comic performances in several films including Hera Pheri (2000),
        Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), and Singh Is Kinng (2008). Kumar
        won Filmfare Awards for his negative role in Ajnabee (2001) and his comic performance in Garam Masala (2005)
